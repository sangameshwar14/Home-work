The project intends to develop a single point interface for easy access, combination and analysis of that data. With a unified perspective, the tool should improve decision-making and eliminate data silo. That is especially true for businesses that need to have complete visibility in order to make decisions. Besides, the tool can help you when you need to migrate data where the aggregated data from different sources is required and needs to be transformed into a standard format. To summarize, this project actually comes in useful when it helps to eliminate the headache of managing different sources and multiple formats of data to allow faster and better decision making through the world-class solutions deployed within an organization."
